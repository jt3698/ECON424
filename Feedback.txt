Proposal comments:

I like the sound of your project.  I have only a few things to say.
- It seems like words are going to be an important part of the analysis here.
  Take a look at the text slides to get some other ideas.
- There's no problem with making revenue your response variable.  Out of
  curiosity, I was also wondering if you could predict genre based on
  covariates.  I'm not sure how revenue and genre are related, but I suppose you
  will be able to figure that out from the data you have.
- One last thing: I don't know anything about this, but it seems to me that the
  movie business is "nonstationary" in some way.  That is, even after you adjust
  for inflation, you may still find that today's blockbusters make more real
  dollars than in the old days.  Is there some way that you can find evidence of
  this happening?  Are movies made differently over time?  I mean, clearly they
  are, but can you find, say, features of an Avengers movie that make it more
  profitable than a Star Wars movie from the early 80s?
- Finally, I haven't looked too much at the data but I imagine that it includes
  lots of different kinds of movies.  You might have clearer results if you
  limit the dataset to films that are, for example, above some revenue
  threshold for inclusion.  But maybe not, I'm just conjecturing that a lot of
  small movies could muddy the signal coming from big movies.  Then again, with
  a careful look at revenues, you might be able to look at features that make
  something either a hit or not, in which case you wouldn't want to throw
  anything out.
